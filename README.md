quick-ish, dirty-ish react demo app as ui for an imaginary system in which users share credentials (netflix, etc) with other users. lists credentials and sublists of users for a given credential. clicking a credential gives details and a pane (if applicable) for adding new users and revoking access from users (deleting users). 

client and server run independently (server doesn't serve client). server is an express graphql implementation that uses an in-memory data structure, e.g. restarting the server resets everything. as a learning exercise i'm rewriting the server in sangria, but one thing at a time.
